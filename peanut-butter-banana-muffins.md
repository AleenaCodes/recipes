# Peanut Butter and Banana Nut Muffins

From the [Thug Kitchen cookbook](http://www.thugkitchen.com/tk1), which is very funny and super sweary, but I've removed the naughty words that aren't entirely necessary for the recipe...

Makes about 12 muffins.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups whole wheat pastry or all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup creamy peanut butter
- ½ cup packed light brown sugar
- ¾ cup plain almond/any non-dairy milk
- 1½ cups mashed banana (about 3 regular size bananas)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ cup chopped walnuts/peanuts/dark chocolate chips

## Method

1. Heat your oven to 375℉ (190℃) and grease a muffin tin, or use paper muffin liners.
2. In a big bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
3. Now in a smaller bowl, mix together the peanut butter and brown sugar until it looks kinda creamy. Stir in the milk, banana, and vanila until everything is mixed up.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir until just combined. If you mix it up too much, your muffins will be tough. Fold in the nuts/chocolate chips now if you are using them.
5. Scoop the batter into the muffin cups. This makes a lot of batter, so fill them to the brim so you get nice, domed, bakery-style muffins. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean when poked in the centre of the muffin, 18-22 minutes. Take them out of the tin and let cool for at least 15 minutes before eating.
